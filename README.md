# DSA Visualizer 🚀

An interactive web-based project to **visually understand Data Structures and Algorithms** through step-by-step animations. Instead of only reading code, users can *see* how data structures behave internally during different operations.

---

## ✨ Features

* Visualizes core data structures with real-time animations
* Step-by-step traversal and operation highlighting
* Clear separation between data logic and UI rendering
* Helps understand time complexity through visual behavior
* Beginner-friendly and interview-focused project

---

## 📚 Data Structures Covered

* Array

  * Insertion
  * Deletion
  * Traversal
  * Insert at specific index (with shifting animation)
* Stack (planned / in progress)
* Queue (planned / in progress)
* Linked List (planned / in progress)
* Trees (planned)
* Graphs (planned)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML** – Structure of the application
* **CSS** – Styling and animations
* **JavaScript** – Core logic, state management, and visualization

(No external libraries or frameworks used)

---

## 🧠 How It Works

* Each data structure is implemented using JavaScript
* The UI is rendered based on the current state of the data structure
* Animations are applied using CSS transitions and JavaScript timers
* Operations like traversal and insertion are shown step-by-step to mimic real execution flow

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project is built to:

* Strengthen understanding of DSA concepts
* Help students visualize how operations actually work
* Serve as a strong portfolio project for interviews
* Make learning data structures more intuitive and engaging

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Add speed control (slow / medium / fast)
* Pause and resume animations
* Display current index and value during traversal
* Show time and space complexity for each operation
* Add sorting algorithm visualizations

---

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Select a data structure and perform operations

---

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository, improve existing visualizations, or add new data structures.

---

## 📌 Note

This project is focused on **learning and clarity**, not on using heavy frameworks. Everything is implemented from scratch to deeply understand how things work under the hood.

Happy Learning! 💙
